## API Security

### Key Security Measures

1. **Authentication**  
   - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens  
   - Secure password storage using bcrypt hashing  
   - Implements OAuth 2.0 for third-party logins (Google, Facebook)  

2. **Authorization**  
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) for endpoints  
   - Property ownership verification for host actions  
   - Session management with secure, HttpOnly cookies  

3. **Data Protection**  
   - TLS/SSL encryption for all API communications  
   - Sensitive data encryption at rest (PII, payment info)  
   - Regular security audits and dependency updates  

4. **Request Validation**  
   - Input sanitization against SQL injection/XSS attacks  
   - Rate limiting (e.g., 100 requests/minute per IP)  
   - CORS policy restrictions for cross-origin requests  

5. **Payment Security**  
   - PCI-DSS compliance via Stripe integration  
   - Never storing raw payment details in our database  
   - Webhook signature verification for payment events  

### Why Security Matters

- **User Data**: Prevents breaches of personal information and identity theft  
- **Payments**: Ensures financial transactions are irreversible and fraud-proof  
- **Platform Integrity**: Blocks abuse (spam bookings, fake listings)  
- **Legal Compliance**: Meets GDPR/CCPA requirements for data handling
